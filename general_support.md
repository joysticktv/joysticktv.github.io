## Unable to access account

Please check your email to see if your account has been flagged as suspicious or restricted. If you have a TOS (terms of service) violation, your account may be closed.

If you had a previous account on joystick.tv with a violation, your new account may be restricted or closed.

If you believe you have been mistakenly flagged, please contact support (support@joystick.tv) with evidence or information that will allow us to review your situation.

## Deleting your account

Go to Settings and select Delete My Account.

If you are a streamer with active subscriptions, all subscriptions will be immediately canceled.
After 30 days, if you have money pending, and it doesn't meet the minimum for a payout, you will
forfeit that remaining amount. Amounts that meet the minimum will be sent via the last payment
request method.

No new subscriptions can be added to your account during this time.
Important: any active subscription will be lost and not automatically renew.

Your account cannot be restored, and you will have to create a new one.

## Two-Factor Authentication

We highly recommend that you enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your account. 2FA helps to ensure that you are the only person accessing your account. After enabling 2FA on your account you will be prompted for a second level of authentation after logging with your username and password.

To enable 2FA please visit your account settings at https://joystick.tv/settings. Look for the Security section and check Enable 2FA.

After you have enabled it, you have two options on how you would prefer to provide the second level of authentation. You can scan the QR code and enter that into an app like Google Authenticator or Authy. Or if you would prefer to be texted your authentication code when you login, enter a phone number. Make sure to hit save further down the page to keep your settings.

If you previously has 2FA enabled, and are locked out of your account, contact support@joystick.tv
