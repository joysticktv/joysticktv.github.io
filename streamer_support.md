## Earnings and Payouts

### Earnings

Multiple ways to earn.

* **Subscriptions** - Set your own price, starting at $3.99/month.
* **Live Streaming** - Receive tokens live with the option to set tip goals.
* **Direct Messaging** - Send direct messages, videos, and images for an amount of tokens you set.
* **Post Content** - Share posts with exclusive content for your subscribers or set a token amount to unlock.

### Payouts

80% Revenue Share. No prerequisites to start earning.

Payouts can be requested once you have earned the minimum withdrawal amount in available funds. All funds received are considered unavailable for 30 days from the day you receive the money. You can think of your earnings like a sliding window. If you receive $1 on July 1st, that $1 will be available to you on July 31st. We do this in order to protect us and you from fraud.

*Payout Options*
* **Check** ($50 min / $2 fee)
* **ACH** ($100 min / $2 fee)
* **Paxum** ($100 min / $2 fee)
* **Wire** ($400 min / $45 fee)
* **Joystick Wallet** ($0 min / $0 fee)

> Please note that with Wire payouts, the first time you receive a payout there will be a slight delay for us to setup your account. After the first payout, there will be no more delay.

Tokens have an assigned value based on their purchase price. Promotional / Free tokens are worth $0.02.

Your payout breakdown is available from the menu, under payouts.

### Receiving Payout

Payouts are sent weekly with the cutoff day being Tuesday. Payouts requested before Tuesday will be sent that Friday. Payouts requested after Tuesday will be sent out the following week. A payout may take 3 to 7 business days to process. Once processed, they are generally sent on Fridays.

Payments have 3 stages:
* **Unpaid** – Your payout has not been received by our accounting department to be processed, yet.
* **Processing** – Your payout has been received by our accounting department, and is currently being processed
* **Paid** – The money has left our offices, and is headed to you. Some payments may take longer to reach you than others (i.e. checks, or first-time wires, etc…)

As a U.S. based company, we observe all U.S. Banking holidays. During these times, there may be slight delays which will always be conveyed via announcements the week prior or sooner.
Checks

Checks are for North American streamers only as these are mailed through the U.S. Postal service (USPS). These are standard U.S. bank paper checks made out in USD. Once a payout request is processed, this is usually delivered to you within 3 – 5 business days.

> Checks not deposited after 30 days may be cancelled and reissued for a $15 fee

**ACH / Direct Deposit**

ACH (automatic clearing house) is similar to a Wire transfer where we use your bank details to automatically deposit funds in to your bank account. We process ACH deposits as next-day (next business day). If your payment is sent Friday, then you’ll receive the funds Monday unless Monday is a bank holiday. ACH is only available for streamers in the United States as the process required only works with U.S. banks

> A $5 fee may be added if we’re unable to process your ACH deposit due to incorrect information.

**Paxum**

Paxum is a service you sign up for https://paxum.com/ that works like a bank account. We can transfer funds directly to your Paxum account account. Once a payout request is processed, this is sent within 1 business day.

** Your Paxum account must be approved and verified in order to receive funds. If it’s not, they will reject the money we send you which will delay payment.

**Wire**

This is a bank to bank wire transfer. If you’re in the U.S. you’ll give us your bank’s account number and routing number to receive the deposit directly in your account. For banks outside of the U.S. you will need your SWIFT code and bank account number. Once a payout request is processed, this is delivered in 1 business day.

Note: We will also ask for the bank’s address for verification. If you have an online bank, you will just need to provide the website address to the bank.

> First-time wires may take an additional 3 business days to send due to Bank approvals. Payments after the first are sent same day.

### Joystick Wallet

You are never required to request a payout. Though, the money is still yours, you have control over how you want to use it. The Joystick wallet allows you to use your funds to purchase tokens, subscriptions, or gifting subscriptions to other streamers. There are no fees or minimums to use funds in your wallet.

For other questions or help, please email support@joystick.tv, or contact us on Discord. You can also visit our FAQ page for more info.


## Taxes for U.S. Streamers

Streamers based in the United States are required, by law, to file taxes on income earned from streaming. For this reason, we require all streamers in the U.S. to fill in an IRS form W-9. Streamers may use their personal Social Security Number (SSN), or Business TaxID if you file as a company (e.g. LLC, S-Corp, etc…).

Streamers outside of the United States are not required to fill out any tax or business related documents, but you may need to look up laws in your country regarding earning funds from a U.S. based company.

### Tax Documents 1099-NEC

As of this writing, the minimum threshold to receive a 1099 is $600 for the entire tax year. If you made this amount, or more, during the previous year, a tax document will be created for you and sent during January of the current year. If you use Paxum as your payout option, Paxum will handle sending you tax documents instead.


## Uploaded Media Content

Verified streamers are allowed to upload their own personal media content. All content must be approved and verified before it may be displayed on the website.

### Examples of good content

* A profile photo
* Online banner image used when your stream is live
* Offline banner image used when your stream is offline
* Video clips of you
* Previously recorded streams of yours
* Your custom emotes
* Promotional images for your upcoming streams

### Examples of bad content

* Photos of anyone else not verified on your stream
* Videos of anyone else not verified on your stream
* Content that violates any terms/acceptable use
* Illegal content
* Any file types other than images and videos

## Direct Messaging Campaigns

Direct Message Campaigns are like Direct Messages but sent in bulk or when someone follows you.

To use this feature, visit this link [Direct Message Campaigns](https://joystick.tv/dm-campaigns). To create a new campaign, click the Create Your First Campaign button.

When creating a campaign, you have to fill in the first two fields. Campaign Name is for your use only. It can be helpful to name a campaign and see how it performed compared to other campaigns you may create. The message to send is what you would like to say in your Direct Message. You have the option to attach any previously uploaded media as well. You can set all of the content to be free or even have it be purchasable with tokens.

There are also several filtering options you can select when sending the message. You can use these filters to help target specific people who follow you.

When you’re done and push the Send Now button, your campaign will be sent within just a few minutes. If you would like to schedule the send for later, you can check the Send Message Later box and select the date and time.
