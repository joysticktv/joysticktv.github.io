## Do I have to stream NSFW content?
Nope! Stream whatever you’re comfortable with. If anyone in your chat asks you to do anything you’re not comfortable with, please notify us immediately.

## Are VTubers allowed?
Definitely. We have many VTubers that stream on Joystick. Feel free to ask them in our Discord about their own experience.

## Do I have to stream games?
No. Even though we like to focus on gaming, if you just want to knit, paint, do wood working, workout, or whatever, we’re all here for it. Just have fun!

## Can I have my partner on stream with me?
Yes, however, they must be approved on your account before they can appear on stream. Go to your stream settings page and add a new Stream Approval with their information.

If they're already an approved streamer, you can invite them to appear on stream through
streamer invitations on your stream settings page.

## I want to play a game with friends. Can their voices be on my stream?
As long as you know they are all over the age of 18, and do not show their faces/body, it’s ok.

## Can I stream to other sites?
Yes! Multi streaming is awesome. There’s several options, from OBS extensions, to 3rd party services that do this.

## Can I stream from a public location?
Unfortunately, no. Everyone that appears on stream must be verified by our staff. Public places make this difficult since you never know if someone will just walk behind you at any given time.

## I requested a payout a few days ago. Why is it taking so long?
We process payout requests weekly. If you request a payout before Tuesday, your payout is generally processed that week. After Tuesday will be processed the following week. There are a few exceptions such as holidays. If you have further questions, please email us, or ask in Discord.

## My check says “sent”, but it’s been 2 weeks. What happened?
Checks are mailed through the standard U.S. Postal Service (USPS). These take roughly 3-5 business days with the exception of busy mailing seasons (e.g. winter holidays). If it’s been longer than 7 business days, we can cancel the check and re-issue for no additional fee.

## Do you allow playing (INSERT ANY RANDOM INDIE GAME) on stream?
Games are constantly coming out, and older games get updated frequently. Keeping up with a solid list is very difficult. As long as the game doesn’t violate our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, it should be ok, but will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If you have further questions, please ask.

## How much are tokens worth?
Token values are variable based on how much was spent buying them. We factor in discounts that
may be given, or affiliate revenue share, and other factors in this. A token's value will be
between $0.03 and $0.11 with the average value being around $0.07 each.

## How much do affiliates make?
An affiliate will earn 20% of each purchase made for users that they have signed up; however, this amount may vary based on factors like token coupons given to a user, or the price value of subscriptions as set by the streamer. See the [Affiliate Support](/affiliate_support) guides for more info.

## How much do streamers make?
A streamer earns 80% of each purchase made; however, this amount may vary based on factors like token coupons given to the user, or users that joined through another streamer's link. See the [Streamer Support](/streamer_support) guides for more info.

If your question hasn’t been answered, feel free to email support@joystick.tv or ask in our Discord support channel for further clarification

## Why are my view counts different from users in chat?

View counts are the number video players that are playing your live stream. This also includes yourself, and users that may be logged out previewing your stream. It's also possible that someone in your chat has your video stream paused. They would count as a user in chat, but not as a view count.
