This is the official site for [JoystickTV Support](https://support.joystick.tv).

## Contributing

We welcome all of our community members to help us keep our guides and resources
up-to-date. If you find a typo, mistake, or something missing that could help
others, please let us know.

If you're a developer that wants to contribute, just follow these steps:


1. Fork it (https://github.com/joysticktv/joysticktv.github.io/fork)
1. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-requested-change)
1. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add your changes')
1. Push to the branch (git push origin my-requested-change)
1. Create a new Pull Request

### Running the site locally

You'll need Ruby (3.1.x or later).

1. Install dependencies `bundle`
1. Visit [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to understand the structure
1. Boot the app with `jekyll serve`
1. Open the site in your browser http://localhost:4000

### Updating Search index

The site is not crawled since it's on the free plan, currently. When content is added and/or changed, we need to reindex the site.

Run this command with the appropriate key:

```
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=admin_api_key bundle exec jekyll algolia
```

> Only Joystick staff will have access to this key
