## What is an Affiliate Link?
This is a URL with a special code that links back to you. When someone visits this URL they will be tracked as a "click" in your reporting. If they signup for a new account, you'll see this as a "join". Once they make any purchase, you'll receive a bonus of 20%.

## How much do I earn?
You'll earn 20% on each purchase a user makes.

## If I refer a streamer, do I earn money on their streaming earnings?
No, but we do offer a streamer referral bonus. This is a one-time bonus of $25 paid to you once the streamer has been on the site for at least 30 days, and has earned a minimum of $100.

## Can I make money referring other streamers?
Yes. We offer a one-time bonus of $25 paid to you once the streamer has been on the site for at least 30 days, and has earned a minimum of $100.

## If I am already a streamer or plan to be one, can I take advantage of this program and become an affiliate?
Yes, we encourage you to use your links on your social media platforms and wherever else you refer users to join your streams. If they sign up and make purchases, you will earn a cut.

## I'm a streamer, but don't see my referral link. Where do I find it?
Your affiliate link is found under the "Affiliate Promotions" menu section. This will appear after your payout information has been submitted and approved.

## I've invited users that have made purchases, but I don't see earnings. What happened?
Our affiliate link tracking system currenly uses basic [HTTP cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) that stay with the user for a period of 2 weeks. If they click your link, but take longer than 2 weeks to sign up, or if they use any sort of cookie blocking mechanisms/plugins (which includes using incognito/private browsing), this may result in them not being tracked.
